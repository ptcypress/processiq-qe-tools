# ProcessIQ

A practical, affordable alternative to heavyweight quality suites — focused on the most-used QE / Mfg Eng / Ops tools, with clean reports and a smooth workflow.

## Who it's for
- Quality Engineers (SPC, capability, MSA)
- Manufacturing Engineers (screening, Pareto, regression)
- Operations Managers (quick answers + printable results)

## What it includes
- Data Explorer (shared dataset across tools)
- Control Charts (I-MR, Xbar-R, p/np/c/u)
- Capability (Cp/Cpk, Pp/Ppk + report-ready visuals)
- Gage R&R (Crossed ANOVA)
- Regression (OLS screening)
- Pareto
- Report Builder (combine outputs → one report)

## 30-second demo
1. Load sample dataset in Data Explorer
2. Run Control Charts and Capability
3. Add to Report Builder
4. Export combined HTML report

## Run it (3 ways)
### 1) Docker (recommended for deployment)
```bash
